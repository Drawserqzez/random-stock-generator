# Random stock generator

## About
This is a small program that fetches available swedish stocks from Avanza.se and then picks a random one that fits a chosen configuration.
Made for a friend who wanted to invest a little in a random stock each month for fun :)

## Usage
This program depends on Requests and Beautiful soup and in the end maybe something else in the future :D

Make sure Python is installed properly

Install requirements

``` pip install requirements.txt ```

Run the program

``` python src/main.py ```

## Configuration 
The program also depends on a config file to work properly. If none exists you get the option to create one with all the necessary variables.
